// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

if(num3 % 2 = 0

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   

var number1 as integer
var number2 as integer
var number3 as integer
var number4 as integer
var number5 as integer

print."What is the first data point?"
call inputtextboxhere.module

print."What is the second data point?"
call inputtextboxhere.module

print."What is the fourth data point?"
call inputtextboxhere.module

print."What is the fifth and final data point?"
call inputtextboxhere.module
number5 = input.module
	 
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

var numavg as integer
numavg = (number1 + number2 + number3 + number4 + number5)/5

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
var smallestNUM as integer

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

print."Avergage of the data sample:"
print.numavg
print."The highest data point:"
print.biggestNUM
print."The lowest data point:"
print.smallestNUM
